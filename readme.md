# COVID-19 parameters estimation

Source code and full polish text of my master's thesis at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. In my thesis I was focusing on COVID-19 parameters estimation through optimisation. I used agent based model instead of pure mathematical formulation. I compared multiple optimisation methods, usage of different data and date ranges and influence of various data transformation methods.
